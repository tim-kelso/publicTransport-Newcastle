# Public Transport Usage in Newcastle
This project aims to track trends in public transport usage across different modes of transport: bus, light rail, ferry, and bike-sharing.

The goal is to determine whether public transport use is increasing as Newcastle's population grows - "Newcastle's 2021 population is now estimated at 453,515. In 1950, the population of Newcastle was 160,911. Newcastle has grown by 3,155 since 2015, which represents a 0.70% annual change" (from https://worldpopulationreview.com/world-cities/newcastle-population)
